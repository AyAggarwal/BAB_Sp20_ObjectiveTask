# Token Contract
## Introduction
A large part of being a developer in Blockchain at Berkeley is adapting to new tools and frameworks effectively.

In this task, you'll be working with the source code of a basic smart contract written in **Solidity**. A compiled JS-like language specific to Ethereum's virtual machine. 

## The Problem
The task is two-fold:
  1. After reading through and understanding the smart contract's code, you will complete a write-up for the general idea of what the contract is supposed to do in addition to doing some research on token standards. Add your response to the file `response.md`.
  2. Find a way to deploy the contract to the live [Ropsten Ethereum testnet](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/13534/what-is-actually-ropsten-what-is-a-new-network) or [Rinkeby Testnet]. This task is intentionally lacking in instructions as you are expected to do research into how this is done; feel free to consult any online written or video guides. It is recommended that you use [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) **(a free online IDE) in tandem with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (a browser extension) to complete this task. You should be able to find your deployed smart contract on the blockchain explorer site [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/), add a link to it to the file `response.md`. 
    **Please use the the Solidity 0.5.2 compiler, as that is the version used in this contract. 
    3. (Optional) If you can figure out how to get this custom token inside of your MetaMask wallet, bonus points! Tell us how you did in `response.md`. 
      
## Advice
If you have never done this before, (which is quite normal!), we realize this can look dauting. Trust us, though, you can do it! There  are many online tutorials on how to deploy contracts and what each specific piece of it means. This task tests your researching ability more than anything else
